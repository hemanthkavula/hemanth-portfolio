## What I Built
- Designed a single-page portfolio focused on data science storytelling with clear section flow.
- Implemented motion-driven UI with Framer Motion (section reveals, scroll progress, hover interactions).
- Built a canvas particle background and parallax glow accents for visual depth.
- Authored content-driven sections (projects, experience, education, certifications) from structured constants.
- Added SEO metadata, Open Graph, Twitter cards, and JSON-LD schema for discoverability.

## Description
This portfolio is a focused, data-driven personal site that highlights my skills, projects, and experience with a clean, modern visual language. I built it as a single-page experience with smooth section flow, expressive motion, and a strong emphasis on clarity—so recruiters and collaborators can quickly understand my work. The design blends a technical aesthetic (monospace accents, subtle grids, and glow treatments) with readable content structure, making it easy to scan while still feeling crafted and personal.
